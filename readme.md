## Objective
I want to try to do more presentations, and people always ask me for my speaker notes so I am gradually going to move them into a consistent format in this project.

I quite like using DeckSet for presentations, so you'll find an `index.md` file in each directory that is the one I present from. However, there is also an `index_full.md` file that contains a much richer set of speaker notes which is what I use when I am rehearsing, and is much more interesting if you are just reading the presentation.

## Presentations
### Pipe Dreams
This is a presentation that I gave to our local Sydney CocoaHeads group describing some of the techniques I've been using to streamline our build pipeline.
